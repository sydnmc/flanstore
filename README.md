# flanstore

simple file sharing platform, hosted on flandre (an hp t530 thin client)

![](https://yui.yuru.ca/ajpyn8ylme.png)

similar to s-ul.eu, each user has their own subdomain and can drag/drop or upload any sort of file to get a shareable link to said file!! wowwww :O

(note: because of being hosted on yuru.ca, disallowed usernames are syd, lilac, api, and of course flanstore as they're used for other website things :p)



## dev notes

the backend server requires `ws, express, multer, and cors` to be installed (`npm install ws express multer cors`) to function properly.

you'll also need to create a blank `userinfo.json`, as well as a `/files` folder for the backend to properly create everything for each user, but yeah >w<

that's it, pretty much :3
